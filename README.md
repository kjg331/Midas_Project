# Midas IT Project(2021.03.14 ~ 2021.07.30)
This is the sort of code I did when I worked for MIDAS IT, and they are not related to any official business of MIDAS IT company.
Below is the description of each code.

1) Communication Labeler

   This is the code for labeling communication among teammates. This is built with semi-supervised, which at first some amounts of the communication was labeled by humans and then labeled my machine learning techniques.

2) Task Automation
   
   Here are  codes to make some task to be automated.
   
   First, "Excel_Combining" is to combine all the contents of Excel sheets into an integrated data Frame.
   
   Second, "Combining Word Table" is the code to extract all the contents of the Word file into the data frame and then preprocess it to the integrated data and CSV format.
